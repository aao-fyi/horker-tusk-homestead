# Horker Tusk Homestead

Horker Tusk Homestead features the best views in the realm of Winterhold College and the Northeastern coastline. Available today and move-in ready, this fully-furnished home can be yours for 9,600 gold coins. With only one previous owner and a steward already living on-site, you won't find a greater bargain in this freezing hold.

Speak to Rakel Gunthe at The Frozen Hearth in Winterhold to purchase the deed.
